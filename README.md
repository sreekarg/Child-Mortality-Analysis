# Child-Mortality-Analysis

According to UNICEF, “An estimated 5.3 million children under age five died in 2018–roughly half of those deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa”. Even though there has been a remarkable progress in reducing the mortality rates globally, the major causes of death vary widely across countries. Despite the challenges in understanding and addressing infant mortality, it is crucial to study this to improve the collective health of a nation.


Thus, the objective of the project is to identify the factors affecting child mortality rate across the world by analyzing the data from all the countries under UNICEF surveillance, which is performed by creating a SQL Database from different datasets.


Technical components and User interface used:

    • A function for Dynamic suggestions for country name has been defined such that a country is name is suggested from the list of countries by matching maximum streak of correct letters in the input given by the user.

    • Try and except blocks have been implemented during the user interface to prevent the errors caused by incorrect user inputs and in turn instructing the user with appropriate message to go further. (while passing country name or year intended)

    • Interactive slider has been included to the interactive figures and charts to help the visualization of data across the years

Conclusion: Data has been categorized and visualization has been done for all countries across the years. And we have observed that there are many factors influencing mortality rate for a country. As almost all countries have a decline in mortality rates, we could observe that a stable government and economy contributes the most for the decline in mortality rates for a country(observed through the countries which have high mortality rates are still either under developed or developing). Through the visualizations done , we can see where a country should focus to better its child mortality rate.
